PlankNN
-------

Neural network code for classifying images in Kaggle's Ocean Plankton challenge.

The pyplanknn folder contains an implementation of a neural network written in Python while the rustplanknn folder contains one written in rust.

Neither are finished and several features are still missing, e.g. dropout.
